# Sponsor me

Hi, my name is Thijs Moens. I live with my family in a small town in the middle of The Netherlands. Here on Github, you'll find a handful of Open Source projects and some learning repos. It all takes a lot of my spare time, so if you would like to sponsor or donate to me, it would mean the world to me. 

With your money, I can feed my curiosity in my exploration of how to create things out of code.
